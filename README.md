# Snake

A Javascript implementation of the classic [Snake Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game))

Basically, it's a snake that you have to move around the board and which grows longer with each piece of food it eats. You lose if it gets so big it hits itself or if it goes off the board.
